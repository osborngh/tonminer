I really thought i was set for life with this piece of code. Lol

It's basically a small script that creates many new TON wallet addresses and feeds them to a now defunct website (which turned out to be a scam).
The website promised to mine ton at a low rate just requiring a wallet address.

Update: The Website is back online as at Nov 28, 2024 but its stil a scam (I believe)
